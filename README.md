This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# üëÄ Demo

- [https://nextjs-prismic-blog-starter.vercel.app/](https://nextjs-prismic-blog-starter.vercel.app/)
- [https://blog.iamsainikhil.com](https://blog.iamsainikhil.com/)
- Prismic Slices available with the starter can be seen in action [here](https://nextjs-prismic-blog-starter.vercel.app/article/prismic-slices).

# üéâ **Features**

Multiple features of Prismic are used in this starter:

- **Slices**: Enrich your blogposts with custom quotes, images or codeblocks. You can order them how you like. When you used the¬†*Image-Slice*¬†the image will get inserted and optimized by¬†**nextjs-image**
- **Relationship fields**: Categorize your blog articles in Categories via a relationship field. You can change categories on the fly
- **Both custom types (Single / Repeatable)**: Articles, Tags, Categories, Author sections of the website are managed with Prismic. The social media links or the header & footer sections are hardcoded content which can be customized easily!
- **Prismic Preview**: Prismic allows preview of any document which comes handy before publishing a document. This starter has got preview setup for article page. For more info, check [here](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/previews-nextjs) and [here](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/768819-preview-a-document)

# üíª¬†Quick start

1. **Create a NextJS site.**

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app

   # create a new NextJS site using this starter
   git clone https://github.com/iamsainikhil/nextjs-prismic-blog-starter
   ```

2. **Install the packages**

   Install the packages using the command `npm install`

3. **Environment File**

   - Go to _API & Security_ section of your _Prismic_ project, grab the Permanent Access Token with _Access to master_.
   - The Repository Name is the name you have entered at the creation of the repository (you‚Äôll also find it as the subdomain in the URL)
   - This project has the support for [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/) comments section which need your DISQUS project name which can be found at _https://<your-project-shortname>.disqus.com/admin/settings/general/_
   - Create an `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Add the following properties in it:

   ```json
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=<your Google Analytics tracking ID> (Optional)

    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=<URL of the deployed app (Optional)>

    NEXT_PUBLIC_PRISMIC_REPO=<your prismic repository name (Required)>

    PRISMIC_API_URL=<your prismic repository API URL> (Required)

    PRISMIC_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your prismic permanent access token> (Required)

    NEXT_PUBLIC_DISQUS_NAME=<your disqus project shortname> (Required)
   ```

4. **Start developing.**

   Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

   ```bash
   # Go to project directory
   cd <name>

   # start the application
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at¬†`http://localhost:3000`!

   Open the¬†`<name>`¬†directory in your code editor of choice and edit¬†the contents. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

# ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

---

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.Open¬†`[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)`¬†to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint or nextjs develop errors in the console.

`npm run start`

Runs the app in the production mode.Open¬†`[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)`¬†to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint or nextjs develop errors in the console.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the¬†`build`¬†folder.It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about¬†**[deployment](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)**¬†for more information.

`npm format`

Formats the app files like _js, jsx, json, and md_ using Prettier. You can learn more about the format **[here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html)**.

# **üßê¬†What's inside?**

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

```

1. **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.
2. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template.¬†`src`¬†is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.
3. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.
4. **`nextjs-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a NextJS site. This is where you can specify information about your plugins config you‚Äôd like to include, etc.
5. **`LICENSE`**: NextJS Prismic Blog Starter is licensed under the MIT license.
6. **`package-lock.json`**¬†(See¬†`package.json`¬†below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project.¬†**(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**
7. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
8. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

# üî¨ **What's inside?**

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in the application.

4. **`pages`:** This directory contain files which represent web pages like 404, index.js (homepage), \_app.js, etc. Moreover, you can generate dynamic pages using the `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` methods based on the structure `pages/[sub-page]/[param].js`.
5. **`schemas`:** This directory contain JSON schema files which represent each custom type defined in Prismic.
6. **`slices`:** This directory is the ‚ù§Ô∏è of the article page with files representing the slices discussed earlier in Prismic setup section.

# üöÄ Deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/iamsainikhil/nextjs-prismic-blog-starter)

# ‚öì Prismic Webhook

Prismic Webhook allows you to automatically or manually trigger a deployment process in Netlify or Vercel if any post is published or unpublished OR for other events in Prismic. I use Vercel as the example and I guess it might be quite similar for Netlify or any other cloud service.

## Steps:

- Create a Deploy Hook in Vercel [here](https://vercel.com/iamsainikhil/nextjs-prismic-blog-starter/settings/git-integration). For more info, check [here](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/more/deploy-hooks)

![deploy_hook_vercel](https://github.com/iamsainikhil/nextjs-prismic-blog-starter/raw/master/README_images/deploy_hook_vercel.png)

- Copy the hook link and past in the URL section of the prismic Webhook
- Create a Prismic Webhook [here](https://iamsainikhil-blog.prismic.io/settings/webhooks/). For more info, check [here](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/790505-webhooks). -

![prismic_webhook](https://github.com/iamsainikhil/nextjs-prismic-blog-starter/raw/master/README_images/prismic_webhook.png)

- The `Secret` field is _optional_ in the Prismic Webhook. If you set it, Prismic will send the content to your server, so that you can verify that the request is coming from prismic.io.
- After successful creation of the Webhook, you can manually trigger it and can also see the logs.

![prismic_webhoks](https://github.com/iamsainikhil/nextjs-prismic-blog-starter/raw/master/README_images/prismic_webhooks.png)

> You can create any number of Webhooks for a prismic project!
